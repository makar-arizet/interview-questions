## Express.js backend

1. Create a simple REST API with express.js and mongodb (do not use Mongoose).
1. Add a health check endpoint.
1. Add an endpoint allowing to create alumni (ID, first name, last name, date of birth, graduation year).
1. Add an endpoint that takes a year and calculates the average age of students for that year with the precision of 3 decimals. Use only MongoDB aggregations for calculations.
1. Add an endpoint that takes a year and a letter and returns a boolean indicating if the names of all students from that year's graduation start with the same letter. Do not use any MongoDB aggregations.
1. Apply good validation and error handling for the last 2 endpoints.
